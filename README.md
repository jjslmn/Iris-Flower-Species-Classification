# Iris-Flower-Species-Classification
This project utilizes the popular Iris Flower dataset. It explores the use of multiple machine learning models to predict which species a set of structural characteristics represents.

To get started with the project, ensure that the 'iris_flowers.csv' is in the same folder as 'final.ipynb'. It begins with preprocessing the data. We find four numeric features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. Following the preprocessing section, three data sets are created to be used by the four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with a Final ensembled model at the end.
