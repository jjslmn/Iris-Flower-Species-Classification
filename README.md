# Iris-Flower-Species-Classification
This project utilizes the popular Iris Flower dataset. It explores the use of multiple machine learning models to predict which species a set of structural characteristics represents. This model could be implemented into an application as a helpful tool for botanists who are curious about which iris flower species they are working with. 

To get started with the project load, compile the 'final.ipynb' file. In the same folder, include iris_flowers.csv. It begins with preprocessing the data. We find four numeric features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. Following the preprocessing section, three data sets are created to be used by the four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with a Final ensembled model at the end.
